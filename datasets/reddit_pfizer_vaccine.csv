NO VACCINE IS FDA APPROVED!!! You can‚Äôt sue ANYONE if you have adverse side effects or allergic reactions. Ask the 43 families who lost loved ones in Norway!!! AUTHORIZATION is not FDA APPROVED!!!,0,la5jlp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PfizerVaccine/comments/la5jlp/no_vaccine_is_fda_approved_you_cant_sue_anyone_if/,22,1612221852.0,,2021-02-02 01:24:12
Comment,2,gmt9wbk,,0,1612991920.0,"There is no FDA approved vaccine for covid. AUTHORIZATION is not FDA approval!!! They are VERY different things. You are basically a volunteer test subject for the pharmaceutical companies. You can‚Äôt sue anyone if you have adverse effects or allergic reactions. No one!!! The media is not showing African protests over their population being used as test subjects. It appears that suddenly the pharmaceutical companies are trusted by USA and other countries now? Purdue pharmaceutical company just settled for $9 billion dollars for lying to people about OxyContin and its addiction yet, people believe that they care about your health?!! 

I got censored for stating what is on the CDC website and the WHO website. You can also still get covid after the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. People have gone into anaphylactic shock after the first dose.  Be sure anyone willing to get the vaccine understands the risks. An Epi-pen is required to be at EVERY vaccination center.!! Per the CDC WEBSITE ‚ÄúMOST PEOPLE RECOVER FROM COVID.‚Äù  If this post gets censored for quoting the CDC‚Äôs own website, be very concerned!!!",2021-02-10 23:18:40
Comment,1,gqerdep,,0,1615376901.0,"Got mine earlier today.  These side effects are no joke. My past vaccine experience is that I typically feel a bit tired after a flu shot, but this is far more intense. 

I have a sore arm and feel like I have a low grade cold/flu - but without any drippage or throat problems. Just feel warm all over, achy, tired. 

I also feel a little bit... weird... not sure if it is psychosomatic or what. I was singing  ""Oh give me a home, where the buffalo roam"" in my car which is a bit unusual. 

I think some of it might be psychosomatic. I have spent several hundred hours consuming media about this epidemic - the MIT lecture series, MedCram, Ninja Nerd, The Guardian, all of it. So I feel off, but also like kind of amazing, like this thing is coming to an end, and my body is a small part of this fight.",2021-03-10 13:48:21

Very quick and not a big deal getting it. I‚Äôm usually a fainter, but I was fine. They suggested taking Tylenol when I got home and I did. Woke up a little sore in that arm this morning, but when I say little, hardly at all.

Edited to add: 2/19/21 (Friday) I received my second dose. My arm was a little sore the next day, but not as bad as the first shot. I had a bad headache around midnight on Saturday, could be unrelated, I get them occasionally. No other side effects thank goodness.

FDA APPROVED means they have stamped it for safety and efficacy and you can sue them for adverse side effects or allergic reactions. They are all getting a free pass now.

It actually states on the CDC WEBSITE that MOST people recover from covid. There are approximately 400,000+ deaths to covid in the USA right now with a population of over 360,000,000 people!!! We lose over 450,000 people a year to cigarettes and vaping promoted and legalized because of the tobacco lobbyists hiding in the shadows of our representatives. If covid could be taxed, our doors would fly open. This is a money maker. Period.

This is a virus that has infected a lot of people but FEW die of it. I WILL NOT take any drug from a pharmaceutical company that is driven by profits.

I was taking a vaccine that was only licensed for EUA and not full FDA Approval. I still made the choice to get the shot and I will have to live/(hopefully not die) with the consequences of it. 

The 33 Norwegians who died were all 80 or older who received the shot and were not in the best of health according to the reports I read; this by no way lessons the impact of choosing to willingly take this 2-part shot, yet I would assume they all also chose to get it freely.

Day 0 (Day of 1st shot): Mild sore arm. 
Day 1: Mild sore arm.  I also developed pretty bad brain fog, and sinus pressure.  
Day 2: Brain fog continued. Moderate/severe fatigue. Almost fell asleep bathing my kids which is crazy.
Day 3: Still have mild brain fog but fatigue has improved.
Day 4: Mild fatigue and mild brain fog.  Evening my stomach felt a little off.  I then woke up at 1:00 am with terrible stomach cramps/diarrhea.  I felt like I was going to vomit.  I also developed nasal congestion/runny nose.
Day 5: Upset stomach/diarrhea/fatigue and mild headache (mild nasal congestion)

Based on the law, any clinical trail which is on the phase 4, needs to collect data from patients continuesly and if there's any weird or unseen events or symptoms, they have to disclose it to public and maybe stop the intervention.

My first dose symptoms kicked in on day 2 and 3 the hardest. I felt waves of just... Feeling icky and fatigued, slightly nauseated. Pain in my armpit (weird but ok, didn't think much of it then)

2.5 weeks later
Second dose, much bigger reaction. Next day I'm feeling waves of Runny nose, chills, upset stomach, and fatigued. Then swelling started in my arm pit and the underside of my arm which received the injection.  Freaked out, I look it up and found that this is turning out to be a known side effect. Yesterday the swelling was big and slightly warmer to the touch, uncomfortable. I took tylenol and it helped WAY more than Ibuprofen did. Last night before bed the site got itchy and gave me some little hives but those went away. I slept in a bit extra and I'm feeling much better today, lymph swelling is way down. No icky waves yet.

I should mention I'm technically obese and have some skin problems like allergies to fragrances and psoriasis. I was eager to get the vaccine but feel kinda bummed it hit so hard. I want to encourage others to get it ASAP but want to be transparent that the side effects are a bit uncomfortable. If anyone has feedback for me I'm all ears.

Also last week I got the worst migraine of my life, it lasted two whole days, with NOTHING being able to quell it, idk if this was bc of the vaccine, I usually get 4 or 5 migraines a year and two Tylenol always takes it away quickly so idk, what do you guys think?... also I got nauseous the day after the vaccine but not too bad but that got worse, it wasn't until the 7th or 8th that my nausea started affecting my diet, on the 10th I got so nauseous I couldn't stomach anything at all, I had to force feed myself but with just a little bit a food, my stomach therefore, I assume, started hurting a lot...

Additionally, the review board that makes the decision is an independent organization.

You absolutely have recourse because a long time ago, a fund was set up for anyone that experienced a true adverse reaction to ANY vaccine. The purpose of the fund is to discourage litigation but also provide more immediate and long term financial relief for anyone that suffered injury due to vaccines. The fund does not stop litigation in the most litigious society in the world.

Comment,3,gmx5bec,,0,1613063323.0,"TL:DR No sooner than 17 days and no further than 42. 


Walgreens currently only lets you do 21-22. I plan to change the date of my first one on their form to a day after my first dose so I can schedule me second one for a Friday so I don‚Äôt miss work if I feel like shit after.

CDC as of 2/10/21

‚ÄúPersons should not be scheduled to receive the second dose earlier than recommended (i.e., 3 weeks [Pfizer-BioNTech] or 1 month [Moderna]). However, second doses administered within a grace period of 4 days earlier than the recommended date for the second dose are still considered valid. Doses inadvertently administered earlier than the grace period should not be repeated.

The second dose should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible. However, if it is not feasible to adhere to the recommended interval and a delay in vaccination is unavoidable, the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines may be administered up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. There are currently limited data on efficacy of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered beyond this window. If the second dose is administered beyond these intervals, there is no need to restart the series.‚Äù

During this time, VAERS received 934 reports of death* (0.0018%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. CDC and FDA physicians review each case report of death as soon as notified and CDC requests medical records to further assess reports.

I could not even open my eyes forv2 days without throwing up. Cat scan. MRI, blood work all ok. 
Dr said could very well be vertigo brought on by vaccine even though no live virus in vaccine your body doesn't know that. There is a viral type of vertigo. 
Went for second vaccine since doc said better than getting covid. I actually had two days feeling better after 2nd shot but now back to waves of dizziness but thankfully no nausea. 
Some episodes put me in bed, bad ringing in ears and feeling like crap. Tinnitus is constant but gets worse with bad dizzy spells. 
Doc prescribed Meclizine but it makes me feel worse and does nothing for dizziness.
It's been a month of this now! Very difficult to work. Can't even walk the dog! I spend most of my day working in bed on my laptop. I just try to cram everything I need to do in between waves. I'm pretty tough and have been fighting through but it is really getting hard not to cry! To top it all off, I am also packing the house to move next week 18 hrs away!

Comment,1,gnwq305,,0,1613699030.0,"I just took my second shot 36 hours ago. My experience was as follows:

First shot-
 - Very sore arm at injection site for the first 48 hours that went away. 
- mild brain fog during the frost 24 similar to a fly shot in my experience

Second shot
- mild and persistent headache for the first 6 hours
- 10 hours after the shot was incredibly tired and went to bed
- woke up about 18 hrs after the shot with mild chill and thirst. Just drank water and went back to bed and injection site was sore similar to the first shot but not nearly as bad (also slept on that side so could be something)
- slept another 6 hours
- woke up still lethargic and mild headache (fortunately took off work) 
- muscle soreness throughout the day. Nothing horrible just feels like I worked out the day before but did not. 
- mild heachache off and on. 

Overall it feels like the tail end of the flu with some soreness and lethargy and a mild headache. It‚Äôs really not as bad as I expected and well worth it for immunity against the potential short and long term effects of covid (since we don‚Äôt know how it will effect each person). 

Overall I‚Äôm incredibly appreciative and elated to have the opportunity to be vaccinated. Still another 10 days or so to build up immunity but thrilled and these minor side effects that I experienced are well worth it. Four coworkers vaccinated at the same time had similar symptoms. Headache, soreness, chills first night, lethargy for 48 hours or so, seem to be common.

Just because a drug isn‚Äôt produced by an American company doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt be made available to Americans under different names. (You ever heard of generic drugs?!) 

20,000 Americans, including pregnant women, were given thalidomide in ‚Äúchemical trials‚Äù in the early 1960‚Äôs causing thousands of deaths and miscarriages along with babies born with malformed limbs. The pharmaceutical company that did this trial with thalidomide was an American company called Richardson-Merrill and Smith, Kline.  Sound familiar?  The side effects were not obvious immediately just as those aren‚Äôt for all these experimental covid vaccines.  When you volunteer to be in a clinical trial for a drug that is not proven safe or effective, you have no legal rights. 

Please be sure to read the fine print before you get a vaccine that has been FDA EUA for use only NOT for FDA APPROVAL and even FDA approval is suspect after President Obama signed legislation that pushes pharmaceutical drugs to market with less research requirements.

Comment,3,gpadm7m,,0,1614625425.0,"Who told you that the mRNA vaccines are safer than getting covid? Pfizer?!!  Moderna?  AstraZeneca?!!  Suddenly, you trust pharmaceutical companies making billions off gullible people?!! Purdue pharmaceutical company just got slapped with a $9 billion dollar fine and 3 criminal charges for lying to the public about opioid addiction!!! Bayer pharmaceutical company is also facing criminal charges. We have a world wide opioid epidemic that is caused by your trusted pharmaceutical companies!!! 

Obama sighed legislation fast tracking drugs through the already overwhelmed FDA that have turned out to not be safe.  Some carry black box warnings now. Many,‚Äò many drugs have been recalled for death and injuries. Ever hear of thalidomide?!!! Please look it up!!! 

If you are at high risk, obese, have type 2 diabetes, have high blood pressure and are just plain basically unhealthy, you certainly should consider a vaccine otherwise, the cdc states on THEIR website that MOST people recover from covid at home! .1% of the entire population of the USA has died of covid.  .1%!!!   We lose more people to health problems related to cigarettes but YOU think the government and pharmaceutical companies care how you die?  

Over 500,000 people die each year from cigarettes but ‚Äúthey‚Äù don‚Äôt care because ‚Äúthey‚Äù tax the hell out of cigarettes. If ‚Äúthey‚Äù cared, we‚Äôd all have affordable health care and cigarettes would be illegal. You have no one to sue if 6 months from now or 4 years you get ANY adverse side effects or allergic reactions to these covid vaccines because they are NOT FDA APPROVED!!! NO ONE IS LIABLE FOR ANY ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS OR ALLERGIC REACTIONS TO ANY COVID VACCINE!! Authorization is not FDA approved!!! 

If covid could be taxed, our doors would fly open!!! It‚Äôs about money!!!  Good luck üëçüèº",2021-03-01 21:03:45

Comment,1,gp2uxsc,,0,1614488872.0,"Been experiencing similar symptoms to what I've been reading here, which makes me feel a bit better today since I'm not alone in this. A little background on me: I'm 38 (m) non smoker, extremely active run/workout 5/6 days a week, fairly healthy balanced diet, no known prexisting conditions. 

Got my first dose of Pfizer on Saturday (2/20). No immediate effects noticed. 

Day 1 - Sunday: Arm soreness, nothing else 

Day 2 - Monday: I feel fine, back to normal. Arm soreness gone. Was able to workout without a problem.

Day 3 - Tuesday: Tuesday evening began to develop a fever. Had chills and cold sweats. Fever went to 102 F.

Day 4 - Wednesday: Fever was up and down, started to develop a sore throat, minor congestion. At this point I was convinced that I caught Covid based on symptoms and went and got tested. Had very low energy and continued to sleep throughout most of the day. 

Day 5 - Thursday: No fever today, but still very lethargic and low energy. Sore throat persists. Results from Covid test came back negative. 

Day 6 - Friday: My body still feels run down. Attempted to workout. It was a struggle and felt like I was working out hungover. Also developed a headache which seemed to be concentrated behind my eyes. Low grade fever (99F) and still super tired. Sore throat isn't as bad as the day before.

Day 7 - Saturday: Slept 13 hours and headache still persists. Sore throat seems to be gone but I'm still low energy and running a low fever (99F). Have not moved from bed. 

I'm thankful to have the vaccine but coincidentally had a week off from work. I couldn't imagine going to work and being productive with these symptoms. If the second dose is allegedly worse, I do not look forward to it. 

Side note: I have been reporting my symptoms to the daily V-safe texts that I get from the CDC.",2021-02-28 07:07:52

Comment,4,gotg8vk,,0,1614366795.0,"I‚Äôve had both injections, my second on Monday (today is Friday for those reading this at a later date). I‚Äôm a teacher who has been in-person since August with underlying health conditions, so any complaints I have take a backseat to the protection it affords.

First injection: got it in the afternoon with no initial symptoms other than some fatigue later that evening. The next morning I woke up and felt like I had fallen on a doorknob with the shoulder that received the shot, which is an atypical reaction for me when receiving vaccinations. I did my usual activities, including some light tree pruning, cursing my arm because it hurt but it didn‚Äôt hinder my activities greatly. The next morning that pain was gone and I had no other symptoms.

Second injection: noticed swollen lymph nodes under the injection arm that are sensitive to the touch. I may be running a slight temperature or I may be overheating easier. I‚Äôve had some mental health issues: increased anxiety and mood swings. My physiology is particularly sensitive to vaccines and medications in general (I don‚Äôt know why, my psychiatrist doesn‚Äôt know why‚Äîjust lucky, I guess /s). It‚Äôs nothing I can‚Äôt recognize and deal with, since I‚Äôve gotten used to living in this body with its many quirks.

Comment,3,goqmaug,,0,1614308632.0,"I am 13 days out from first Pfizer shot. No real issues until about day 7, then started this persistent daily headache. I can‚Äôt get rid of it, tylenol etc does nothing. Since I do NOT have Covid it must be a reaction to antibodies but I can‚Äôt do my usual things with this pain.

I am hoping this headache stops soon‚Äî probably right before my second shot.
UPDATE:
My headache succumbed to Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen, aspirin, caffeine) and Salonpas small patches on my temples (menthol, camphor, etc, not the lidocaine ones altho my doctor recommended those too, as well as recommended nicotine patches). Anyway it stopped about two days before my second shot.
After my second shot I was flat out for 36 hours with body, joint pain, tiredness, and low grade fever. The next day I was mostly normal. Headache stayed on for four or five days but was able to knock it back with the Excedrin Migraine once a day.

Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine Obsevations,33,l96w0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/PfizerVaccine/comments/l96w0h/pfizerbiontech_vaccine_obsevations/,76,1612104893.0,"I (44/M) was inoculated around 6:45 in the evening on Wednesday, Jan. 27 with the Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine. I received the vaccine at a mass inoculation site at our local Expo Center. I am technically part of the 1b group, but was able to get the shot at the tail end of the 1a group, due to some wrangling by my employer.

I experienced some dizziness and splitting headache about 10 minutes after the injection (in right deltoid) and mild pain at injection site, while I was waiting in the 15 minute observation waiting area after the shot was given. On the 28th, I felt some nausea and dizziness again about 14 hours later and another bad headache. The nausea and dizziness dissipated shortly and the headache later in the afternoon. The injection site was slightly more painful. On Friday, 29th and Saturday, 30th, basically no symptoms. Counting my blessings.

Why I choose to get shot?

1) Health Concerns. I have some underlying conditions (Asthma, Hypertension and a few others).

2) Opportunity. I put my name in early with employer, got the call, drove to the site.

3) Research. If you read the trial data on the vaccine BNT162b2 it was 95% effective against COVID-19, 7 days after the 2nd dose: https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577?articleTools=true

What makes me apprehensive about this shot?

1) We do not know the long term side effects of the vaccine. Should I wait until this is determined?

2) Rabies, Influenza, Cytomegalovirus, and Zika have all had vaccines created with mRNA (all of which I have not had), yet the #1 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and #2 (modeRNA) vaccines use this new delivery system of mRNA for vaccination. Is mRNA truly safe for humans? 

3) The trial lasted 111 days (July 27 to Nov 14, 2020), so does that mean the vaccine was created in 4 months 17 days (139 days) minus the initial testing on humans, if you use the day of March 11 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this a pandemic? My memory tells me Dr. Anthony Fauci on many press conferences, said it would take a year to a year and a half to create a vaccine, yet Pfizer-BioNTech did it just under 5 months and also created a vaccine with a 95% efficacy. It almost seems to good to be true? 

4) LNP (Lipid Nanoparticles) is such a new technology in medicine, relatively speaking, it is also worrisome the effects this will have on our bodies with this vaccine?

5) Why is there such a heavy push to get vaccinated by the media and political affiliations? And why all of a sudden IS THIS vaccine free to anyone, but other vaccines are not? Who is paying for all of this?

6) If I wait until the summer when it is rolled out, will there still be enough available? Will there be a syringe shortage, as some are talking about? Will there be some other issue that arises, that I will not be able to get the shot, when the opportunity to get it is now?

Finally, some observations about the evening I received my shot:

1) There were some 40 booths set up, one after the other at my site, giving out the vaccines. It was not very private or HIPPA regulated, as one would normally see in a hospital setting and maybe this is because the government (ie. tax payer) is on the hook for the shots and privacy is not a concerned.

2) The nurse giving me the shot was (to my understanding) not a licensed nurse but a student nurse from the local university...not sure if this matters or not? My muscle of my arm had some spasms as it was being injected by her.

3) Before I got my shot, I had to wait a few minutes for it to be drawn up. The problem with this was, I had no idea what was injected in me, as I never saw the vial the ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù was drawn out of. It was very much like the scene at the end of ‚ÄúThe Wizard of Oz‚Äù, when the wizard came out from behind the curtain; a different nurse came from behind me through these make-shift booth curtains to hand the student nurse a syringe. I asked to see the syringe for any information on it, but all it had on it was a lot #. The nurse said to me, ‚Äúthis is your last chance to back out.‚Äù In conversation with her prior while I was waiting, she had told me she had yet to get the vaccine, but it was offered to her as part of the nursing program. She was still undecided to get hers.

4) As I was rushed to the booth, I was handed a 6 page document about the vaccine, that I did not really get to read until I got home later. Maybe it was my naivety about the vaccine, but I did not realize the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was not approved by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) but rather fell under an EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) by the FDA. Under section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), the FDA Commissioner may allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by CBRN threat agents when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. READ EVERYTHING YOU ARE HANDED BEFORE YOU TAKE THE VACCINE, SO YOU CAN MAKE THE BEST INFORMED DECISION. I might have waited on getting it, had I known this little snippet about it, regardless of the claimed 95% efficacy.

I will update my post, if I experience any more symptoms. 

I am scheduled Feb. 17 for Dose #2. Am praying this was the right decision, despite my objections above.

Good Luck to those thinking about this difficult decision themselves and their families. It was not an easy one for me, even despite having already gotten the vaccine.",2021-01-31 16:54:53
Delayed Symptoms From 1st Dose 5 Days Later,54,l8skoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PfizerVaccine/comments/l8skoz/delayed_symptoms_from_1st_dose_5_days_later/,75,1612061387.0,"I thought I would share my experience with the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine in case it's more common than I think. I had gotten it last week on Thursday (Jan 21st) and the only early-on symptom I had that I could confirm was from the vaccine was arm soreness at the injection site which was mostly just the day after and really not bad.

Fast forward to Tuesday, I started having really bad chills for a couple of hours while out eating with my Fiance, and checked my temperature when I got home and I was 99.1 (after drinking water so probably actually higher). My temperature stayed in that range for 2 days (Tues and Weds) along with the chills and I clocked it as high as 99.5 when intentionally avoiding water for 30+ minutes to get an accurate reading (yes, I hydrate a LOT). I also had bad chest pain, likely from muscle aches and tightness, and I was pretty convinced I had contacted COVID from my Fiance's coworker who tested positive a couple days prior.

My Fiance and I got tested and both came back negative so I can only assume this was a very delayed reaction to the vaccine, but I felt mostly better by Wednesday so all in all it just lasted about 2 days.",2021-01-31 04:49:47

i got my second dose of the pfizer vaccine on tuesday, and for the most part felt fine the next day.  even the arm soreness was diminished from the first shot.  last night, however, approximately 30 hours after the shot, i decided to have a snack of chips and salsa.  these were left over from a meal the night before in which i had eaten a ton of both without any problem.  

only three dipped chips into my snack, my tongue started burning SEVERELY.  felt like my mouth was on fire.  i have a very high tolerance for spicy food and this was just some jalapeno based salsa that, as i mentioned, i had a lot of the night before and, if anything, was disappointed with how mild it was.  not so the next night.  my face turned red, my eyes were tearing, and no matter what i tried to do to ease the burn - bread, milk, ice cream - it lasted for nearly 30 minutes.  never experienced anything like that, and i eat habaneros, ghost peppers, etc, whenever i have the opportunity.

the only thing that could have done this is a reaction to the vaccine.  i did some research on capsaicin-induced mouth burn as a possible immune response and couldn't find anything but mentions of spicy food as being good for strengthening the immune system, but that's about it.  it was so weird.  i want to try it again tonight to see if the same thing will happen, but i honestly don't want to go through that again.

anyone heard of this or a physiological mechanism to explain it?  i had a bunch of co-workers who got the second dose today, so i have asked them to try tasting some salsa tomorrow in a mini experiment.  i'll report back if others notice the same effect or i am an isolated case...",2021-01-29 09:56:53

Second dose,29,kx253z,https://www.reddit.com/r/PfizerVaccine/comments/kx253z/second_dose/,25,1610644033.0,"*UPDATE - I survived. Last night was rough, but this morning I was fine (other than being exhausted from lack of sleep and a sore arm from the injection site). My supervisor had the opposite experience; she was fine all day yesterday but had to go home within two hours of being at work due to fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Our program director experienced these side effects after her first dose, but nothing after her second. My advice: try to schedule the shots on days when you are able to rest afterward and the following day; it seems like side effects vary but it would be safer to give yourself some time to recuperate :)

I just received my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine this afternoon at 3:30pm. I felt fine immediately after, and figured I would have a pretty uneventful experience like I did the first time around (had no side effects except for a sore arm the next day). At around 7pm, I started to get a headache that got progressively worse. I laid down for a bit and fell asleep, only to wake up a few hours later with a headache, strong cramps similar to period cramps, and a low grade fever (99.1 temp).

Comment,2,gusf8vn,,0,1618649004.0,"It‚Äôs likely due to the fact that mRNA vaccines are more potent than traditional vector-based vaccines. This explains their effectivity too. We‚Äôre asking our cells to make a single viral protein and then presenting A LOT of ONLY that protein for our immune cells to see. This makes them go crazy in the response (a good thing) and thus makes us feel like crap. Now to compare that with a traditional vaccine. In the vector-based vaccines, there‚Äôs usually more than just viral protein that your immune cells will see (dilutes the immune response, not necessarily a bad thing but is less potent) and the AMOUNT of viral protein is less than that of an mRNA vaccine. This is because our cells use the mRNA to make the protein, which can happen more than once before cells destroy it (analogy: you can refill a plastic water bottle more than once, but eventually you‚Äôll probably throw it away). So the ‚Äúwhy do we feel like crap‚Äù question is most likely because of this - it‚Äôs just more potent... which makes it an efficacious vaccine.",2021-04-17 11:43:24

I know people who have had far more severe side effects from the second dose than the effects of actually having COVID, which certainly gives me pause. Getting COVID is certainly still a risk but having one dose significantly reduces that risk and to add another 10% of protection compared to the 66% percent certainly of negative side effects from the 2nd dose really doesn‚Äôt seem worth it.

Comment,2,gumgj39,,0,1618534489.0,"Alright, so after reading through the horrific accounts of peoples experiences on this sub, I was hesitant to go get my vaccine yesterday. But I followed through with it, even despite all the scary anti-vaxx news sites and vids my mom has be sending from all the quackademics.

Was a little nervous waiting in line, but the process was very easy. The shot itself doesn't hurt at all. Tried to keep my arm as relaxed as possible during administration of the vaccine. I didn't feel dizzy afterwards, if anything it was just a little high from an adrenaline rush. Chugged a bottle of water and felt totally fine. Earlier in the day I had eaten some fruit and snacks, as well as took some electrolyte supplements. 

Fast forward day 2 and there is still no symptoms other than a slightly sore arm which I am trying to keep moving and active. 

Will update after my 2nd shot and let you all know how I feel.

I think this is a great opportunity to help combat the pandemic. Yesterday on the radio I heard 7 Million people wont get the vaccine because they don't know it's FREE! The other half of people voluntarily not taking the vaccine happen to be republicans. Hahah what a world",2021-04-16 03:54:49

Comment,1,gum1nbq,,0,1618528046.0,"My vaccine experience:

first dose: March 22. Felt fine the first 2 days and woke up in the middle of the night on the 3rd day with nosebleed. Had 4-5 episodes of nosebleeds in a day. Went to urgent care and the doctor said it‚Äôs allergies üôÑ. I do get mild nosebleeds when I take Zyrtec, but hadn‚Äôt take any as my allergies start in may. I was hesitant to take the second shot, but the doctor said to take it as I have a history of nosebleeds. I also experienced major fatigue from days 3-7.   
I think the nosebleed had to do something with the vaccine....

second dose: April 13. Took the shot at 1 pm and felt perfectly fine until 9 pm and the body pain kicked in. April 14- had to nap every 3-4 hours due to fatigue and body ache. Starting running low grade fever around 5 pm, but did not take any Tylenol. By 2 am in the morning, I was feeling great. Woke up this am feeling good, but then felt a sudden drop in sugar and fainted. Again,  not sure if it has anything to do with vaccine or not, but I have been super stressed about getting the second shot after my first shot experience. Not sure if I should go to urgent care as I think they will say that you have passed out a couple times in your lifetime, it has nothing to do with the vaccine.

24/03/2021: First dose
Sore arm for 24 hours. Nothing else

14/03/2021: Second Dose
Nothing except dead arm around 4 hours post vaccine. Diarrhea around 6 hours post vaccine. Took Imodium and 2 paracetamol and slept through the night.

Woke up 16 hours post vaccine. Achey body and muscles, like really bad post gym DOMS. Took paracetamol again. Went to work and powered through. Felt fatigued and foggy in my head. 20 hours post vaccine, aches got worse. Went to nurse in my school to get more paracetamol. She took my temperature and it was 38.4 (around 102/3 I think!) Took more paracetamol and went home. Currently 24hours post vaccine and in bed with hot water bottle. Only managed to eat a slice of toast all day. 

I am rarely sick so this is a weird one for me. Honestly don't think I've ever had a fever. Gonna try and sleep for a while and hopefully begin to feel better!

Update:

10am: was able to wake up and get out of bed, my body was really achy, felt like a hangover (I did have a few celebratory drinks of whiskey), was fatigued, but other than that i felt fine.

Took it pretty easy during the day, by the evening I wasn't nearly as sore. 

9pm: Took another 1000mg sip of tincture
10pm: went to bed

1pm (48hrs in): I feel pretty good, not 100% more like 95%.

Wasn‚Äôt expecting much this dose as I‚Äôm one of the last in my area of hospital to get the vaccine and 99% people seemed to have only complained of a sore arm.

Had my shot 11am, arm hurt within 20 min. 6-7hrs later felt a bit ‚Äúoff‚Äù and fever sensation started (don‚Äôt own a thermometer).
That night I tried to go to sleep early but hello insomnia. 5 hours of tossing turning, I was a bit hot and sweaty but the insomnia was by far the worst part. Had to take something to fall asleep at 3am and called in sick for work.
24 hours post dose I felt ok, bit fatigued but 10 mins of light cleaning and I felt I was burning up. Took hours to fall asleep that night again.
48 hours post dose I woke up feeling ok but once I was at work and walking around/talking I was incredibly fatigued, slow, mild nausea, headache, felt like I was burning up. Took something to help me sleep last night.
72 hours post dose: again woke up feeling alright today but once at work felt the same as the day before but now muscle/body aches and pain, headache was worse, moderate photophobia, and brain fog. Went home from work early.

I only weigh 45kg with little muscle mass, the only others who have reacted this bad in my workplace are the smaller ones (but only on second dose).

Next day, I had a very sore arm and the mild nasusea.  Was able to go about my day but needed another afternoon nap.  That night, my arm was hot, I developed a large black and blue at the injection site and had even worse nightmares but otherwise able to go back to bed.

I woke up afterwards still feeling as if I had someone pressing on my chest and my dry cough had now become extremely desperate and shook my entire body.

PpppppI spent that entire day in bed with an ongoing ,headache.

Day 7 I woke up much better but so tired and nauseous for about the next few days. Now I'm still tired with bouts of nausea but now am having HORRIBLE diarrhea......and this is only from my first shot so I'm not sure how much worse it can get with the 2nd

I woke up on the floor with a bump on my forehead. This has never happened to me before. The pain kept me awake about an hour, and woke me up two more times in the night. I had chills and sweats. I don't have a thermometer but must have had a fever. Pain so intense and all over, I wanted to not be in my body anymore. The next day I felt exhausted but I steadily improved. Motor function in my hands was bad, I guess from swollen joints. I kept dropping/breaking things. By evening, I was almost completely fine, just a little tired.

It bothers me that I can not find any information about similar reactions, and I can't figure out anywhere to report my symptoms. (The CDC thing I signed up for today doesn't ask about what happened over the first 24 hours, only how I feel today). I don't know who I can talk to to understand what happened. I am scared about going through this again. I am scared it will be worse.",2021-04-12 13:04:58

The first dose sets up/primes our immune system while the second dose brings about a potent immune response along with the production of antibodies. The whole point of the double vaccinations is simply that you want your immune system to produce a high enough level of antibodies that if you‚Äôre exposed to COVID-19, your body can effectively fight it off. Also, the commentary in the article I found from the Israeli doctor discussing the effectiveness of the first dose (which you might be referencing) did include him stating the second dose is very important to get. ü§ç",2021-04-11 08:50:31

Comment,5,gu1vaxw,,0,1618097669.0,"Hey all, I was SO NERVOUS to get my 2nd dose after reading through this thread but I wanted to share my experience in hopes it helps ease some anxiety. 

I am mental - I spent the past 5 weeks scouring the internet and social media for ANY information I could find on the Pfizer vaccine. Whether good or bad I just wanted all the information I could to make the best decision. 

Dose 1 - I got it on March 13th and I was extremely nervous. I got my dose, waited the 15 minutes and drove home. I was extremely anxious and just kept taking deep breaths to calm myself. To keep my mind busy I decided to go to Target (because Target is calming and the best). Walking through target I felt in a daze. I felt loopy and a bit dizzy, but by the time I left Target I felt much better. That day I cleaned my apartment and used my arm as much as I could to help the soreness. I went to bed with a sore arm and woke up the next morning with ZERO soreness. The next week or so I had a VERY mild headache (1 on a scale of 1-10) and a bit of dizziness but again, my anxiety causes this feeling too. I felt 95% from day 2 after getting my first shot on. 

Yesterday at 8:15AM after being EVEN MORE nervous for my 2nd shot, I received my 2nd Pfizer shot. I waited the 15 mins, went home and felt fantastic! I went for a 4 mile walk as it was gorgeous outside - came home and worked. Last night I took 1 Tylenol extra strength in preparation to wake up to feeling like I was hit by a truck. I slept great, woke up this morning and I am now 26 hours post vaccine and feel 100%! NO headache, NO fever, NO chills, no chest pains no dizziness no nausea, no fatigue...

I feel fantastic. 

I read that taking a good multivitamin and keeping hydrated helped, so that‚Äôs all I did in preparation of the shot. I am 31 and 155 pounds and have asthma and horrible seasonal allergies.

My husband, my sister in law, my mother in law, my father in law, my father, my best friend, my boss, my coworker, her boyfriend, and my nurse friend all felt the exact same way. NO issues with shot 2, or very MINOR issues like being sleepy or a mild headache. Maybe we are the lucky ones, but that‚Äôs 11 of us - all with minimal ANYTHING with both shots. 

Maybe shot two will still hit me later, but I am relieved and thankful.

Passed out, woke up at 6am lifeless, head pounding and strong fatigue. Had to take the day off work due to to fact that I couldn‚Äôt think straight and had a fever of 102 and chill. Fever lasted about 8 hours and getting out of bed was a chore. It was a tough day, unlike anything ive ever experienced

Next day I felt 65%, enough to get out of bed and work but was still getting chills and fever. 

Day 3 85%. Mild headaches throughout the day but had enough sitting around and walked and played 9 holes of golf. Played amazing.. maybe it‚Äôs the shot. 

Day 4 - woke up with a headache still feeling a little fatigue and now have a mild dry cough. Mind is racing. Do I have Covid?

Anyone experience anything similar? Should I get tested or is this just my body fighting back?

Comment,1,gto05m8,,0,1617812278.0,"I also experienced swollen lymph nodes on the opposite side, in my armpit, neck, and under my jaw. Everything I've read suggests that it's common to experience it on the same side as the shot, but mine, like yours, were only swollen on the opposite side. I also had a second wave - for me, after the initial reaction (aches, joint pain, fatigue) resolved, I felt better for a day, and then the lymph nodes swelled and became painful. They have improved a bit but are still noticeably tender five days after the shot (two days after first becoming swollen). In discussing it with friends and family, five other women (three pre-menopausal, two post-menopausal) said they had a delayed second wave of side effects, so I think it is actually pretty common, even though we don't hear about that possibility! I hope you feel better soon! Despite the discomfort, I'm eager to get the second shot. What we're feeling is better than COVID, itself. Seeing what long-haulers endure, I'll take some swollen lymph nodes for a few days in exchange for protection from COVID!

So far just a very sore arm and a bit of fatigue. Thanks for sharing your experiences, everyone! Knowing what to expect took the edge of my anxiety.

Update: Felt fine until about 13 hours post vaccine. Currently under a pile of blankets with severe muscle aches, chills, headache, and a low grade fever. I‚Äôm not going to sugarcoat it, the aches have me on the verge of tears. Took Tylenol and hoping that l can get some sleep. I do have a very reactive immune system. My partner also got his second dose and he is fine apart from a very sore arm. I‚Äôll update in the morning!

Day 2 Update: fever finally broke at 4am. Felt bad all day but thankfully fever and chills are gone. Headache, brain fog, and muscle soreness. I have a very reactive immune system in general, so I‚Äôm not all that surprised, but my symptoms were more severe than I expected! It‚Äôs 8pm now and I‚Äôm exhausted and achey.

1st shot had sore arm at injection site immediately, achy and sore arm pit on the injection side, transient muscle aches, mostly on injection side of body. Insomnia. All lasted 4 days and resolved.

2nd shot. Sore arm at injection site. 4 hrs later, 100.3F fever. Mild fatigue. Entire arm and injection site soreness. 6 hrs the muscle aches started. By 8 hrs joint pain involved.  This lasted the next 24 hrs. Easily treated with Advil Dual (ibuprofen  + acetometaphin).

The first night, night severe diarrhea.  Like every hour for 6 hours. Didnt realize there was that much shit in the human body.

Woke on day 2 with sore and swelling lymph gland on the injection side arm pit. Can not wear a bra and tender to the touch. Muscle aches subsided. Joint pain more pronounced. 100F Fever transient, maybe 3 times spiked during the day. Diarrhea slowly decreased through mid afternoon and never reappeared. All aches treated with Dual Advil and hot Epsom salt bath. Insomnia persists.

Day 3. Aches subsided. No diarrhea. Fever gone. The under arm  swelling persists and is clearly visible. Injection site pain gone. Insomnia only half the night. Fatigue persists.

Days 4 to 6. Fatigue resolved. Only the underarm swelling persists but is  markedly decreasing in size. Minimal pain. No longer tender to the touch. Insomnia resolved by night 5. 

Day 7. Almost all side effects resolved. Armpit swelling gone and only tender under firm touch. No other side effects remain.

Comment,1,gtgn2gc,,0,1617664892.0,"You ever hear of a cytokine storm?  Do you realize that you may be actually inviting covid to mutate by getting the vaccines?  Next fall, covid may come back as a SUPER bug because everyone is getting vaccinated. In order for this virus to mutate it needs live hosts. It will continue to mutate to survive.  If you allow your immune system to fight it, it will already have developed the antibiotics to protect the body. I wish you all the best. I‚Äôve studied this virus as much as humanly possible, not in the philosophical sense but the SCIENCE of viruses. 

I have a low grade respiratory infection called sinusitis caused by an off label prescription given to me by a physician. Two surgeries later, it won‚Äôt go away. I won‚Äôt risk getting a vaccine that is experimental with no long term knowledge of its side effects. I won‚Äôt risk dying from a vaccine that has no FDA approval. 

I have been mindful of getting covid. I‚Äôm covid free after a year of this. Do whatever makes you happy. I seriously don‚Äôt care if you want to get a vaccine, please do!!!  I DO care that the vaccines don‚Äôt prevent covid from reoccurring and quite possibly, are doing the exact opposite of what they are supposed to do. The vaccines are creating an environment for covid to mutate and become stronger and possibly, create a super bug. If that happens, God help humanity. We are already seeing mutations across the globe. Given that the human body has the ability to create its own antibodies to viruses ü¶†, I‚Äôll let my immune system continue to fight off covid which it‚Äôs done a good job of.

Comment,1,gtglxwy,,0,1617664377.0,"Pfizer doesn‚Äôt say 6 months. They just continue to follow vaccinated people from trials. And so far they just have 6 months of data of people being vaccinated. Some articles / titles worded this in a way that we can expect 6 months coverage, but it‚Äôs not that. 

It‚Äôs more, at 6 months, they still offer some pretty strong protection (around 91% if I recall). And this is really good news. 

https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/01/health/pfizer-covid-vaccine-efficacy-six-months-bn/index.html


The annual vaccination is just speculation for now. We need more data to see how the different vaccines will still be effective after a year. 

Here is an article that shows really good data after one shot of Pfizer / Moderna

Like you, my partner is at high risk of dying of Covid (organ transplant recipient, kidney disease and diabetes) and let‚Äôs face it, in order to protect vulnerable people, we need to get them vaccinated but we also need to get people surrounding them vaccinated. 
I still think the 4 months stretch is an acceptable compromise in order to protect a maximum of individuals and the community by extension.

Firstly, maybe some are hoping, but nobody expects the vaccine to provide protection for a couple of years. Pfizer say maybe 6 months (the point of my post), others say probably a few months longer. More likely an annual dose, like flu, but only if administered properly in the first place (not happening here yet)

Regarding 1/2 vaccinating more people. Some of the population are more vulnerable than others. Some are exposed to more risk. That is why the initial rollout was to front line workers and seniors over 80. But even many of those (i am one) have had second dose extended to 4months.",2021-04-06 01:23:59
Comment,1,gtgewh7,,0,1617660955.0,"Nobody knows for sure. 
But, there are good chances that it won‚Äôt affect the efficacy negatively, even after 6 months. The 21 days is arbitrary. 

And let‚Äôs say, worst case scenario, our protection doesn‚Äôt last the couple of years they are hopping, we will probably be in a situation where vaccines are more widely available for all. 
I think the small trade off of personal protection is worth, considering it will allow to protect more people faster and potentially reduce the risk of developing variants.

Around hours 2-3, I felt fatigued and my arm became progressively sorer by the hour. Upon getting home, I fell asleep, waking up sweating after 3 hours with a very low grade fever (98.7 F). I felt nauseous most of that night, and my arm pain peaked between the 24-48 hour mark. I couldn‚Äôt sleep on that side for several nights and had trouble raising it more than a few inches. I‚Äôm now three days out, and that pain has subsided for the most part. I continue to feel fatigued, and have had to cut back on my exercise routine, but I‚Äôm in the process of changing my sleep schedule so that may play a factor. Looking forward to being fully vaccinated in a few weeks!

As a side note, my heart rate was faster than normal and I had a tiny bit of chest pain the day of the shot. However, I chalked it up to an anxiety response, as I had been very worried about getting the vaccine and both symptoms subsided once I calmed down.",2021-04-04 19:28:14

Comment,0,gt9cl13,,0,1617496942.0,"‚ÄúmRNA vaccines have been studied before for flu, Zika, rabies, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). As soon as the necessary information about the virus that causes COVID-19 was available, scientists began designing the mRNA instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mRNA vaccine.

Future mRNA vaccine technology may allow for one vaccine to provide protection for multiple diseases, thus decreasing the number of shots needed for protection against common vaccine-preventable diseases.‚Äù

Comment,2,gt9bykx,,0,1617496616.0,"No. I‚Äôm not trying to start a war with people but not one of the vaccines are FDA approved for safety or efficacy. They got EUA which means the pharmaceutical companies can distribute the vaccines but they are not liable for the safety or efficacy of the vaccines. The media is guilty of interchanging the term APPROVED when authorization should be used. 

The government approved EUA of the vaccines but not FDA approved. It‚Äôs very different! They are approved for distribution not for being safe or effective against covid. The pharmaceutical companies have zero liability and are making a fortune off vaccines that normally are studied for about 10 years before getting FDA approval thus, the term EUA; EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION. 

If people want to get injected with an experimental vaccine because the benefits outweigh their risks, so be it but it is a personal decision to get ANY pharmaceutical drugs and is a decision to be made with their physician and it‚Äôs a personal decision. People have died from the vaccines. If you want to get one, it should be a choice. Why are we at war about this?  I definitely don‚Äôt want covid but almost everyone I know has had it. I‚Äôd rather get covid than the vaccine.  I have medical issues that preclude me from the risks of getting an experimental drug. That‚Äôs MY business. If you or anyone else wants to get the vaccine, please do but remember, no one knows the long term effects of these mRNA vaccines.",2021-04-04 03:36:56

Comment,1,gt3qaw1,,0,1617360315.0,"I've been looking for similar issues but it's hard to find any posts regarding late and strong responses to it.

Got my first Pfizer shot on March 22. Only had a sore arm most of the week. On the 26th(last Friday) I had a slight sore throat and body temp at 99F.  By that weekend I had body aches but fever was gone.

This week I started to have a strong cough and it's been getting worse to the point I can't sleep. No other symptoms besides respiratory.  Feels like I have some serious bronchitis and an asthmatic attack. I deal with allergic asthma and regular allergies so it is really wrecking me. I'm currently taking Allegra, Mucinex and an albuterol inhaler and it's not enough. Might need to go to urgent care if it gets any worse.

How old are the kids? I can definitely sympathize with this situation, I have a 4 yr old. I‚Äôll just say that the day I was knocked on my butt he enjoyed a LOT of extra tv time and easy to make but not the typically ideal meals.

Comment,2,gsmy60p,,0,1617007169.0,"Hi all, I had my second Pfizer vaccination 10 days ago. Felt fine until about 12 hours later, then it kicked me in the pants so to speak. I was told that at 62 year old I might expect mild side effects. Not at all mild for me. My arm was a only mildly sore but I became extremely lightheaded... like I had a couple bottles of wine without being buzzed. Rather I had sort of stoned feeling and not a good stoned like the last time I used drugs in the 1980‚Äôs lol.  I was moving about badly, could not walk a straight line to save my life. That persisted and very slowly diminished over 7-8 days. I also had chills and sweating for about 3-4 days. Muscle aches and pain ramped up and have just now started to subside. Nasty headache for 2 days, significant lethargy and fatigue still occurs. Also became a bit cranky and depressed which are quite unusual for me. Crankiness is gone, depression remains as does muscle pain. Bottom line is this, it has kicked my ass. Is it worth it, yes. I‚Äôve had numerous friends become ill with Covid, another friend is in the VA ICE as I write this. Also have lost 2 acquaintances to Covid. Let‚Äôs all hope and pray that there are not long term consequences to the vaccine. There are no long term studies so far, they are sure to begin appearing at some point. I‚Äôm betting there will be some long haulers who endure side effects but time will tell. All in all, I‚Äôm glad I have been vaccinated. As I ‚Äújoked‚Äù  with my wife while we  were watching I Am Legend and awaiting vaccination, ‚Äúwe are either going to be one of the zombies or 2 of the people being chased down by the zombies‚Äù I am of course being facetious, nothing like would ever occur.

What's interesting is that my husband received the Moderna vaccine (1st dose) on Friday and he is tracking with almost the same symptoms as mine but seems to be about 24-36 hours behind me.  This has been crazy. If we had known we would experience this we would never have taken the vaccine.  We are both extremely healthy and practice Bikram Yoga 3-4 days per week.  I couldn't imagine getting through a yoga class anytime in the near future.  Symptoms are listed here:

  

Day 1: 

Sore arm (very sore), otherwise good. Normal day. No fever

Day 2: 

Sore arm, fatigue, chills??? (mild but present) and normal day. 90 Minute Hot Yoga class, fatigue but otherwise good. No fever

Day 3: 

Sore arm, fatigue, chills (mild), but I did a yoga class and aside from being extremely tired was fine. No fever

Day4: 

Fatigue got worse and had strange muscle pain, not like normal post exercise recovery. It was almost a burning soreness with muscle fatigue. No fever BP 130/72

Day 5: 

Fatigue, severe headache, stuffy nose, chills. Tylenol and Advil do nothing for the headache, can't sleep because of headache, chills and stuffy nose. No fever. Did a hot yoga class and mostly laid on the mat.

Day 6:

Insane crushing headache, Advil and Tylenol are still not doing much, lots of sinus pressure, can't sleep because of head congestion, sinus pressure and headache with chills, coughing ensued, sore glands and a strange tenderness in the back of my throught and roof of my mouth and fatigued. The headache is gripping and tinnitus is bad. No fever BP is 126/80

Day 7: 

The worst. All the symptoms from yesterday but slept most of the day and didn't leave the couch. Took cold medicine for congestion and Tylenol for headache. Slept off an on propped up on pillows. Tinnutis is bad. No fever

Day 8:

Woke up with a headache, less severe than yesterday. Chills and sweats are gone. Congestion seems to be lessening hour by hour. No joint or muscle pain. No fever BP is 127/70 

Advil is helping take the edge off the headache but it is ever present.

Day 9:

Still can‚Äôt sleep. Headache is mostly controlled with Adil and Tylenol. Sinuses are stuffy and fatigue comes and goes. Taste and smell are on and ff. I have a strange floral aroma and taste that stays with me all day. No fever",2021-03-28 04:17:31

He also absolutely insisted to get the 2nd shot, and I was like 'everyone says the 2nd is the worst, I can't go through that hell again' and he assured me that I probably wouldn't have a reaction at all the second time, because my immune system built up a ton of antibodies during the month I was in hell.

Comment,1,gs45bsa,,0,1616660527.0,"If only it were that easy, every single person on the planet reacts differently to anything you put in your body, of course there are many people who have migraines, but you can't and shouldn't assume to know or discredit someone else's experiences with the same health issue(s) you have and what treatments help or not.

I'm sorry Tylenol doesn't help you, I wish everyone could snuff out migraines with a couple cheap OTC pills, but it just doesn't work that way. I consider myself very fortunate that it's highly effective for me. 
I AM clinically diagnosed FYI, and what I feel from them is terrible, but to you, you might feel that yours are much worse (or mine are nonexistent) because from your own personal experience trying Tylenol; it did nothing.


I'm not saying one's migraine is worse than the other, but short of being able to jump into someone else's body there is not one person in the world who can truly experience exactly how someone else really feels. 

However sarcastic your reply, I too wonder how I can sign up for several health conditions I have that could be cured by something so simple. Don't we all though?",2021-03-25 10:22:07

I also had the virus in March, and can tell you 100% the virus is worse than the vaccine.  I stopped breathing in my sleep randomly several times and woke up gasping for air.  My o2 was in the 80‚Äôs when I checked.  The virus caused temporary central sleep apnea for me, among many other terrible things.

Comment,1,gs1lmy8,,0,1616620257.0,"Received my first dose last Wednesday at 3p in upper left arm. I had no issues the rest of the day.
Woke up Thursday at 4:30a for work. Felt like someone sucker punched me in the arm. Only tender to the touch but no tenderness when moving arm. 
7a my coworker shows up and I noticed a metallic odor. I questioned my coworker if he could smell it. He wasn‚Äôt sure. We both assumed it was something sprayed by maintenance working in another room. 
1p the metallic odor is now tasted in my donut and my lunch. It‚Äôs much more prominent. Both shoulders were also tender and warm. I felt drained. 
3p I felt even more tired. It was similar to the finale of a flu. No fever. Metallic smell and taste continued. 
5p we picked up dinner and ate. I felt physically better but my tastebuds were slightly off. 
7:30p I worked out with my Oculus. Noticed I was physically exhausted and my left upper arm was sore. I had to quit by 9p due to sudden vertigo and nausea (a first using the oculus). Immediately laid down due to strong nausea. Fell asleep. 
Friday 4:30a arm wasn‚Äôt as sore, no vertigo or nausea, but physically tried. I can smell and taste metal. 
By the afternoon, my lower left diaphragm felt tighter than usual. ‚ÄúElephant on the chest‚Äù feels in and off they the day. 
Saturday: smell and taste slightly metallic but more musty-like. Physically I felt better. Arm wasn‚Äôt tender. Chest still a little tight. No cough. 
Sunday: felt like crap all day. Sluggish physically and mentally. Chest tight and sore in both lower diaphragm. It reminds me of bronchitis minus no cough. I do has asthma but it‚Äôs usually accompanied with a cough when my lungs feel this way. Light headache. Laid down most of the day. Smeller and taste is still off. More of a musty smell than metallic. 
Monday: I felt physically better but both lungs were still tight in lower diaphragm. Felt tired by afternoon. Tastebuds and smeller still not quite right. 
Tuesday: no changes/same situation. Got tested for COVID. 
Wednesday: I feel more drained than the past two days. Lower lungs on fire. Tight chest. Coughed up a small chunk of phlegm at 6a and it didn‚Äôt smell nice. Taste buds and smeller still off. Waiting on my test result. Maybe I do have bronchitis for tis the season for it (spring allergies can trigger it). 
Prior to the Pfizer inoculation last Wednesday, I did NOT have any of the symptoms I had the next day or continue to have today. I hear the side effects last a couple of days. Mine have lasted 6 days. Fingers crossed I am COVID neg.",2021-03-24 23:10:57
Comment,2,gs1d71f,,0,1616615268.0,Just had my first Pfizer shot on March 22nd at 4:30 pm.

I really don't know how they can do this. Sure it's great to have more people get the first jab, but Pfizer was approved in Canada based on the original Phase III s. In those, everyone got second dose after 21 days. 

We will have some sort of protection between 14 days and whenever we get the second dose. But nobody really knows how well we will be protected. No trials have been done with second dose after 16 weeks. They are using us as guinea pigs.

Comment,2,gructyc,,0,1616468403.0,"Wow, sorry to her that! That's pretty scary. I was actually having trouble breathing and my chest felt really heavy too the first day I got the fever but I chalked it up to my anxiety just freaking me out thinking I had Covid again. Now I wonder if it was indeed an actual symptom from the vaccine. I am hearing more and more that people who have already had Covid get way worse symptoms from the first dose and zero symptoms from the second dose, which was my experience.

Comment,1,grrtfye,,0,1616410628.0,"Sorry you are having lingering side effects. That has to be frustrating not having full ROM especially considering the job you do. 

Here is the CDC link (if you are in the US) you should have been provided for tracking side effects. I assume you can still register though not sure how the reporting will differ since it‚Äôs been a bit since you got the vaccine. I originally was prompted to report daily, then weekly, and now I get a prompt ever couple of weeks. I think CDC is trying to document any and all types of side effects both long and short term so I‚Äôm sure your experience would be important. I think they also contact people under certain circumstances if there are unusual of lasting effects.

Within the first hour fatigue, drowsiness, and nausea started. At 3 hrs, arm pain began that radiated to scapula and pectoral/axillary area. I took 400 mg naproxen and 626 mg acetominophen. It's worked well, arm isnt in pain. But I'm impossibly sleepy, kinda weak, like the day after a hard workout or a night dancing, and significantly nauseous. I'd compare the nausea to early pregnancy.

That night (12 hours later) slight soreness at the injection site. The next day I had a little pain which quickly went away in my neck which may have been from the way I slept. Now 3 days later I feel fine and have no pain or soreness. Also, 4 other people in my house got the Pfizer vaccine and had the same experience as me. Just remember to use your arm after you get it. I am an EMT and have seen what this virus can do to people. I have spoken with my colleagues who had Covid and received the vaccine and they all said they would much rather deal with the side effects than get Covid again. I hope this helps any of you who are worried, nervous or on the fence about getting the vaccine.

Second dose update. So I received my second dose 4/6 it is now 4/14 and all I had was a sore arm, no fever and I was tired. The tiredness was probably just from my regular day to day. Also, before I went and got the second dose I made sure to be well hydrated and drank a bottle of Pedialyte. I am not sure if this helped but I have 6 family members who drank it and got their Pfizer vaccine with no reaction.

Comment,6,gr7drr5,,0,1615983919.0,"No no no no no. Take a deep breath. So for the Pfizer vaccine there were over 43,000 people in the trials. A total of 6 people died over the course of several months during the trials. None of which had anything to do with the vaccine itself. 4 of them didn‚Äôt even receive the vaccine, they got the saline placebo. Of the 2 that were part of the trial and received the vaccine, one died of a heart attack over 2 months after getting the 2nd dose. And the other, who died 3 days after the first dose I believe, had (can‚Äôt remember the exact name of the condition) something that is essentially hardening of the arteries, like plaque buildup and such which happens over a long period of time usually from bad diet, smoking, genetics etc. All 6 were just in a very very large trial group and death for one reason or another just happens when you are considering such a large cross section of people of varying ages and health history. Please try not to stress about it. Do something nice for yourself to take your mind off of it. And when you do get your second vaccine, keep in mind that if you do experience any side effects (mostly feeling like you‚Äôve got the dang flu for 24 hours in most cases) have been fairly common. Just get rest and let your body do what it‚Äôs supposed to do and take comfort in knowing you‚Äôve done your part to help stop this awful virus AND protect yourself and your loved ones.

I‚Äôll try to remember to update after the 2nd shot.

I did have a 3 min panic attack while sitting in the waiting room for 15 min after the shot. That was the worse part!

Also if you‚Äôre just browsing through Reddit and looking for vaccine experiences from people, understand that these types of posts are probably heavily skewed towards people with negative experiences. More than likely, it doesn‚Äôt even cross someone‚Äôs mind to post updates when they had zero to little reactions to the vaccine. Just throwing that out there bc reading this thread made me super nervous getting my shot!

My friend in her early 40s, in shape,  not obese, had a full day of fever and body weakness after the 2nd moderna shot. But she said it only lasted like a day. But her fever did get to 101, which freaked her out.

**2ND SHOT UPDATE (3/30):** I got my 2nd shot yesterday. I have slight soreness on the spot on my shoulder where I got the shot. And I feel muscle soreness and maybe a tiny sluggish today. Other than that, feel so happy that I got my shot! I have 3 other friends that got vaxxed at the same place (Pfizer shot) yesterday, and they all feel fine today :D

Today is my third day after getting the vaccine, my head feels heavy and i feel like I‚Äôm kinda in a daze almost.

Comment,5,gqt68py,,0,1615681238.0,"Hey everyone,

I had a lot of comfort and help from everyone posting observations on here and wanted to contribute.

I (20M) got my first dose 3 weeks ago. After getting it, I sat in the observation area for 15 minutes and didn‚Äôt feel much different (my arm didn‚Äôt even feel sore). I did feel tired, but it was towards the end of the work day.

During check out, they had me bring down my mask to check for rash/irritation. I had no symptoms in terms of that.

About 2-4 hours later, the inside of the arm that got jabbed started to feel itchy. It felt like my muscles were itching.

Right around that time I started to feel pretty tired. I fell asleep and woke up the next day feeling normal.

I felt normal since then. I was tired at points, but I usually feel tired due to poor sleep quality.

I got my second dose yesterday at 4:45PM. The process in the observation area was the same for me. Once again, I felt more tired, but it was towards the end of the work day.

I felt normal for afterwards. I went back to work and even did some physical activity after. I didn‚Äôt feel tired like the first one caused me to feel.

I went to sleep at around 12am and woke up at 4AM (12 hours from jab) with chills. Shortly after experiencing the chills, I had feelings of anxiety. 

The anxiety went away after a couple of minutes, but the chills persist. 

It is now 11:14am. I have chills (less intense), a headache (feels like when you sit on the couch for too long or go on the computer for too long), and slight dizziness.

I hope the symptoms end here and, in the end, am glad I had the opportunity to receive the vaccine.

Comment,2,gqqnh2y,,0,1615616655.0,"I had an antibody test about a month ago which came back positive meaning I had a mostly asymptomatic infection of Covid at some point. 

&#x200B;

I had heard that people previously infected can experience the stronger reaction from the first shot of the vaccine that most people experience after the second shot.

&#x200B;

It seems that was the case. I had the shot Tuesday afternoon and it is now Friday afternoon. Tuesday night I was more tired than normal and went to bed much earlier than normal. Wednesday, woke up in the morning after a rare 8 hours of sleep and still felt very tired and sleepy. Had a weird ""reverberating"" headache, different from the tension headaches I normally get. This was the type that hurts more when you cough or bend over.

Luckily this type of headache seemed to respond to pain relievers a lot more than my tension headaches normally do, so I made sure to stay on my doseage of alternating acetaminophen / ibuprofen. Took a nap Wednesday afternoon. After that, went out to buy a coffee and the clouds seemed to dissipate and I started feeling great from almost exactly 24 hours after the shot.

&#x200B;

Then the next day, Thursday, yesterday, I felt great, until the end of the day. I may have ""pushed it"" by going for a walk in the evening, after which I felt totally drained, which was concerning for me and weird. I went to bed early again last night. Seems like day two of symptoms was much more mild though, as I didn't have headache or chills or anything, just felt tired and sleepy.

&#x200B;

Today is Friday and I'm feeling great so far. Don't think I will go to the gym for a few days, just to be safe and save my energy. 

&#x200B;

I did not experience any nausea and the pain/swelling of the injection site was even less than I normally get from the flu vaccine.

&#x200B;

**Question:**

I've been trying to find (even anecdotal) information online about this but it's hard to find. I know the reaction to the first shot is expected to be bigger for those who had prior Covid infections. How does this fare for the second shot? Should I expect a similar reaction? A bigger one? A smaller one?",2021-03-13 08:24:15

Comment,2,gqnoscp,,0,1615552722.0,"Ello chums, got my first Pfizer vaccine 7 days ago and here is my experience so far:

Slight soreness in arm as expected, nothing crazy.

Day 2: had a sudden flash of fatigue, I was at work and felt stupid, could barely answer customer questions. Had my gf drive me home cus I didn‚Äôt feel safe to drive a car. Got home, watched a movie and 4 hours after the onset it cleared up it was really strange.

Day 3: no symptoms

Day 4: right at the end of the night felt ‚Äúnot good‚Äù but couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on what it was, drank a bunch of water and switched to a relaxing activity and that seemed to clear it up

Day 5: Woke up fine, I noticed my appetite was a bit suppressed and wasn‚Äôt able to eat much. Later in the night developed headache/chills/ and felt like the discomfort of a fever but not actually running hot. The night was rough, took many hot showers and sat in front of my mini heater most the time to satisfy the chills. Finally fell asleep and slept through till about 7am next day.

Day 6: Woke up a little more nauseated than the day before so had myself some alka seltzer (felt like a hang over) and immediately went back to bed cus of fatigue. Woke up around 11:00 am and though I was feeling better which was nice cus I was running behind on schoolwork so I was able to focus and get some of it done. Still had no appetite, could only intake liquids like water/smoothie/ and for some reason a banana was accepted by my body. Thought everything was groovy except around 6pm got hit with another wave of fatigue/headache/chills which sucked. Took an ibuprofen 200mg but stomach got upset because I haven‚Äôt been eating so no dice.Went back to the hot showers and heating fan and eventually fell asleep but felt very hot all night.

Day 7(today): Woke up feeling pretty normal, again got a banana down and a smoothie, tried some toast but no dice. Was able to get some more school work done but then again around 6pm hit by a wave of this fatigue/headache/nausea but definitely not as bad as the previous nights. Still haven‚Äôt been able to eat much which is also contributing to my headache and fatigue but drinking lots of water and also pedialyte seemed to help. This time took a ibuprofen 200mg again but tried to fill my stomach as much with water to avoid nausea and it seems to have helped, I‚Äôve kind of snapped out of my ‚Äúchills‚Äù state. 

I am 25 M, and don‚Äôt use any drugs or drink alcohol, I also don‚Äôt take any daily medications accept Claritin. I tried to provide as much details as possible to give those considering getting the vaccine an idea of my experience.

Helpful Notes:
If you‚Äôre gunna take hot showers, make sure to drink LOTS of water so you don‚Äôt get dehydrated .

Drink plenty of water.

If your appetite is messed up like mine try to eat liquid foods that have calories so your body has something to work with (applesauce/smoothie) or whatever your body agrees with. Any amount of nutrients gives your body what it needs to fight off the invader (vaccine).

Try small doses of Ibuprofen if you can.

Hope this helps!",2021-03-12 14:38:42

Last night: Arm started to get really sore. Had trouble falling asleep, achy body/sensitive skin started happening. Woke up in the middle of the night with chills, turned up the heater. Partner said it was really hot but I kept complaining I was freezing. 

Today: no energy, achy body and sensitive skin feeling has persisted. Cancelled my one client for the day because I have zero energy to give to another person right now.

First 12h after jab.

My arm hurt like properly hurt and felt heavy but didn't feel that bad. Blood sugar wise my control was average, no extremes.

12 - 48h

My arm was sore internally and I felt like crap, I noticed my sugars kept sky rocketing then crashing which is odd. 

48h to 72.

Major hankering for protein, donno why I just needed meat, the pain in my arm was subsiding and I could finally sleep on it.

72 h to One week on

So after about 72h my arm stopped hurting and all of the feeling like crap ended. However, I did notice that my bloods kept crashing, for about 2 days solid day 6 and 7 no matter what I did I could not get my sugars up, so I had hypos (low blood sugars) after hypos especially during the day.

I will probably make a post of my own about this topic later. Anyhow, I had slight tiredness in my shoulder, but it lasted no more than an hour. My wife on the other hand, had soreness all day and felt sleepy. I was infused with a burst of energy. So, while she slept all evening I did chores around the house and went to Costco to get stuff we needed and still managed to work on things for my job well into the night (I'm a teacher). The next day I noticed I woke up with a rock hard erection, common I know, but lately my libido has been down. The pandemic has done a number on my overall health. I spend all day sitting at my desk teaching through Zoom or grading, or other stuff. I currently live a very sedentary life. That day, however, I made love to my wife 3 straight times. I hadn't done that in 20 years. I made love to her again the next day and the day after. She doesn't even want to see me in the bedroom anymore.

Second dose: 6-8 hours after vaccine, felt tired and slightly foggy- went to sleep.

12 hours after vaccine: woke up with body aches and a headache.  7/10 on pain scale each.

From this point, fever went between 99.9 F and 100.5 F for 18 hours- diminished appetite as well.

During this time, I was in bed- I would wake up with the head ache and body aches and I would have this need to stretch and move to try to ""escape the pain"" but there was no getting away from it this way.

Taking several hot showers really helped ease the body aches and even helped the head ache momentarily.

30 hours after vaccine: fever vanished, body aches and head ache went to a 2/10.  Got up and ate.

36 hours after vaccine: Head ache gone- body aches mostly gone (1/10)

48 hours after vaccine: Body aches gone- I noticed some of my lymph nodes on the side the shot was taken are sore.

Comment,2,gpn4ie1,,0,1614885813.0,"Getting my second dose today. I was supposed to get it tomorrow so I could ride the side effect wave over the weekend. Wallgreens called last night and said they don‚Äôt think they will have any stock come Friday as they haven‚Äôt received a shipment notification for it. They moved my appointment to today. So now I‚Äôm getting it today but I can‚Äôt miss work tomorrow. Crossing my fingers that I don‚Äôt get knocked on my as after it.


Update: got it yesterday around 2pm. It‚Äôs now 6am. A bit of a sore arm and a very very slight nasal drip.

10am. Skin is a bit sensitive

11am. A little tired.

1pm. All the above and a few aches but not terrible.

2:30. Chills and super sensitive

4pm everything is fine. Feel like I‚Äôm in the clear.",2021-03-04 21:23:33

Comment,2,gpm3mif,,0,1614857017.0,"I‚Äôm about 6 days past my second dose. 

1st dose‚Äîa breeze! Just pain in the arm. 

2nd dose‚ÄîWoke up with slight chills and body aches after receiving it the night before. As the day went on it got progressively worse. From about 11-630 I had really bad chills and body aches. It honestly felt like I had been in a car accident! It was very uncomfortable!! But as random as it came on, it also went away randomly! Around 630 I started feeling better. I slept about 9 hours that night and woke up the next day feeling fine! 

When I woke up I had barely any pain where I received the shot but I did have pain in my armpit for about 2 days! I checked and it said some people get pain there due to their lymph nodes!

That‚Äôs about it! I‚Äôm feeling fine now!!",2021-03-04 13:23:37

Comment,2,gpjai7u,,0,1614810042.0,"Had my first dose on 23/2, within 15 minutes of having the jab I started feeling achey and heavy at injection site. I suffer with chronic migraine and have been getting mild attacks since the jab. 
By the next day I started feeling extremely fatigued, all over achey/muscle fatigue and chills. Over the next few days to add to this I started feeling waves of nausea, dizzy spells and mad itches on arms. 
I'm now on day 8 and still experiencing all of the side effects.
Tried to go into work today and was sent home within the hour, currently awaiting call back from GP as I'm also concerned now at how long this is lasting with no relief or sign of improvement.
Hope you feel better soon!",2021-03-04 00:20:42

Comment,1,gpdoomm,,0,1614686736.0,Three hours into my first shot. Only a small amount of pain in arm so far. I feel fine otherwise. I was quite nervous and had some anxiety right after injection but felt better in about 20 min. That‚Äôs not unusual for me and my history with anxiety. I will let you know how it progresses.,2021-03-02 14:05:36
Comment,1,gpdit92,,0,1614683492.0,"Got mine first dose yesterday, Feb 28. Will update as long as I have effects, and when I receive the second dose. 

For reference: I typically have a reaction to flu shots. In 2018, I ended up swelling, bruising, and getting a rash, whereas most years I only get minor swelling and ache, and maybe a slight immune response ‚Äúlike the flu‚Äù. To be fair, I typically also get colds around the same time, I tend to get sick the week in October the same week I schedule my vaccine. I have had some reactions (mostly the swelling) to medications/injections, so I was required to wait for 30 mins post injection. 

Day 1, immediately post dose: absolutely nothing, I barely even felt the needle. 

Day 1, up to 6 hours: if anything, just tired. I had a 2 hour ride to the site I went to, and 2 hours back. Both in the pouring rain, about 40¬∞F. Didn‚Äôt eat til fairly late, and over ate at lunch. Could be many things. Ended up sleeping from 6pm until 9pm. 

Day 1, approx 8 hours post dose: arm started to get sore. This was about 10pm. Continued to get more sore overnight, ended up rolling onto arm while sleeping, which woke me up. 

Day 2: all day arm is pretty sore, sometimes for just pressure, sometimes it‚Äôs a constant sore. Guess depends on what I‚Äôm doing. Just spent approx. 2 hours meal prepping for the week, cutting veg and cooking, so it is a bit sore just from constant moving. It‚Äôs now 24 hours since soreness started (32 hours post dose) and I just took band aid off. No visible bruising/swelling etc.

Day 3: 48 hours later, soreness finally wore off. Small bruise, but no swelling. Let‚Äôs hope that‚Äôs the end of dose 1 side effects!",2021-03-02 13:11:32
Comment,1,gpddt13,,0,1614680805.0,"I received both doses as of 26th. The first dose was restricted to side effects of just pain at the injection site. I would rate it as moderate that lasted about 24 hours tops. Then all good. The second one had side effects very similar except far worse. My injection site was very sore that night (took my shot at 1:45PM). To the point that it kept me up late and I couldn't sleep on that side at all. I didn't take any pain meds just so I didn't reduce the efficacy. The next day the pain persisted, with redness and swelling and didn't reduce at all. I also had a small headache (less than moderate), just a small throb on and off. The following day, more of the same but with the shoulder pain reduced to moderate and below. Still a very small head throb every now and again. But now it is Mar 1st and I feel totally recovered. My shoulder feels the shot if I press against it but otherwise it is fine. Hope this is helpful.",2021-03-02 12:26:45
